    <img src="sam_profile_pic.jpg" alt="Sam Profile">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Samuel is a Physics Graduate from the University of Bristol. 
        Samuel has chosen the DevOps Engineer route due to his previous experiences
         in coding Python and working with databases on his university course. 
         Further to this DevOps encourages a much more collaborative approach
          which lends to Samuel's people skills which have been learned through 
          previous experiences working within hospitality and retail. Samuel 
          enjoys going to the gym, playing football, and reading. He has also 
          represented his University on their gaming team. This involved competing 
          against other Universities and has obtained a cash prize as a result of 
          the team placing 2nd in the tournament. Samuel is keen to work with a 
          client as a DevOps engineer as he feels that he can be an integral part 
          of their team and feels that using his problem-solving and analytical 
          skills learned in his university course on top of his communication 
          skills he can work towards solutions effectively and efficiently.
